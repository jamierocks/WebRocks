<h2 id="whatisneptunepoweredhttpwwwneptunepoweredorg">What is <a href="http://www.neptunepowered.org/">NeptunePowered</a>?</h2>

<p>NeptunePowered is all about providing the best Minecraft can offer.
  We accomplish this by taking the best of Minecraft today, and preparing it for tomorrow.
  Currently we are working on Neptune, described below.</p>

<h2 id="whatdowedo">What do we do?</h2>

<p>We currently develop the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneVanilla">NeptuneVanilla</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneForge">NeptuneForge</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whatisneptunevanilla">What is NeptuneVanilla?</h2>

<p>NeptuneVanilla is an implementation of <a href="http://canarymod.net/">CanaryLib</a> for 'vanilla' Minecraft.
  Doing the same thing as CanaryMod, NeptuneVanilla differs in implementation and how closely it resembles 'vanilla' Minecraft.</p>

<h2 id="whatisneptuneforge">What is NeptuneForge?</h2>

<p>NeptuneForge is an implementation of <a href="http://canarymod.net/">CanaryLib</a> for <a href="http://www.minecraftforge.net/">Minecraft Forge</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whataboutarno">What about Arno?</h2>

<p>Arno was renamed and lives on through NeptuneForge.
  Little change was made during the transition to Neptune, however much of it's code was moved into NeptuneCommon 
  something of which it is now reliant on.</p>
