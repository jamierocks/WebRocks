<p>Today is Neptune's first birthday and although Neptune has changed a lot over that year. I am pleased to announce that NeptuneVanilla (now the only Neptune implementation) is in beta!</p>

<p>You can get beta builds from my Jenkins instance - <a href="https://ci.jamierocks.uk/job/NeptuneVanilla/">https://ci.jamierocks.uk/job/NeptuneVanilla/</a></p>
