<h2><b>1. Watch_Dogs</b></h2>

<p>
For the first game I'm looking forward to I've picked Watch_Dogs a mix of Grand Theft Auto and hacking. Watch_Dogs has amazing graphics, an alright sized and dynamic world. Here is a video showing off Watch_Dogs' beauty.

<h2><b>2. Quantum Break</b></h2>

<p>
For the second game I'm looking forward to I've picked Quantum Break. From the creators of Max Payne, Remedy brings yet again another amazing game, Quantum Break and if you don't believe me watch the video below.

<h2><b>3. The Crew</b></h2>

<p>
And last but not least, The Crew. The Crew yet again brings us another brilliant racing game. Time after time Forza Motorsport and Need For Speed bring us new experiences and brilliant graphics and I expect no different of Ubisoft with, The Crew.
