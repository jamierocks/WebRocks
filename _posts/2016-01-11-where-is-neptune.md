<p>Almost 1 year ago I started Arno, what is now NeptuneForge. To be exact I started Arno on Saturday 14th February.</p>

<p>At the time I had 0 interest in expanding to implementing for Vanilla Minecraft as CanaryMod existed and I thought there was 0 point, however as CanaryMod (and CanaryLib)s development started to slow I realised there was lots of reason to have Vanilla support too.</p>

<p>Things were renamed and Neptune was split into three parts: NeptuneCommon, NeptuneVanilla and NeptuneForge.</p>

<p>It was soon after this that NodeCraft provided us with a server to test on. For which I am massively grateful.</p>

<p>By the end of 2015, much of CanaryLib had been implemented, and many plugins partially run on Neptune. In particular I was pleased with implementing commands, something of which took me quite some time.</p>

<p>It is now 2016, and I hope to enter a beta phase for both NeptuneVanilla and NeptuneForge very soon.</p>
