<p>(This is an import of a tweet I made with twitlonger a while back)</p>

<p>So the British Government want to stop companies using advanced encryption techniques, so that they can prevent terrorists, etc from using the Internet as a safe zone to communicate. :/</p>

<p>This is rather silly of the British Government, and will pave way for a far less secure Internet. <br />
As proven by the recent hack on TalkTalk, hackers exist - be it in groups (such as Anonymous) or a single person (such as the kid who hacked TalkTalk). </p>

<p>Although hackers generally hack to prove a point (such as a company's security is weak), hackers often reveal customer information, such as account username -> passwords. While previously this information was encrypted to such a standard, the encryption was one-way (you could encrypt it, but not the reverse) the Government now wants the ability to be able to decrypt this information.</p>

<p>This is outrageously bad, because if the Government can decrypt the information; so can other people.</p>

<p>It is my hope that in-light of this people will start to use security methods such as two-step-authentication, so that just know the decrypted username and password isn't enough to access an account.</p>

<p>However this is not the end of the Government's efforts to help themselves. The Governments now also requires every company to track all their users search histories for up to a year! <br />
Some companies have already been doing this for a large period of time, such as Google. This is why I use DuckDuckGo as my default search engine.</p>

<p>I should mention that all the Government needs to access this information, is a warrant or a hacker to have made the information publically available.</p>
