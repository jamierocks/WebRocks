<p>(EDIT: Since writing this post, I am now helping maintain CanaryLib through the normal repositories, Neptune will be soon updated)</p>

<p>Fast approaching is the Minecraft 1.9 update, of which under current circumstances CanaryLib would not be updated. This is a pain for those who use CanaryLib.</p>

<p>This is why I started FlintPowered, part of the NeptunePowered team. FlintPowered will specialize in the development of FlintLib, our continuation of CanaryLib.</p>

<p>More information will be available soon, however for now the GitHub repo should be sufficient.</p>
