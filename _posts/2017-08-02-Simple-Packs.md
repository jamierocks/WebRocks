Having gone about playing the 3D-era Grand Theft Auto titles, I found out
that an implicit requirement for doing so was: installing mods. Mods are
not a mystery for me, and I was more than happy to do so - but I was in
foreign teritory and wasn't sure where to go looking.

After some searching through existing guides on the Steam Community,
through GitHub, gtagaming, and gtaforums - I has assembled a collection
of mods of which improved GTA3 to a very playable, and near modern
experience (other than graphics of course). I then went about doing the
same for GTAVC, and will continue to do so for all older games I go about
playing.
