<p>Some time ago someone recommended I try LastPass, a password manager. I disregarded the suggestion until a few days ago when someone else recommended I try out a different password manager, Dashlane.</p>

<p>After some brief analysis, I found LastPass to be more appealing to me, probably because I found their website to look nicer.</p>

<p>Using LastPass I can say that I won't lose passwords, and I don't feel bad about reusing passwords occasionally, as I am now using much more secure passwords and different ones for every service. I can safely say that I feel that my online accounts are somewhat more secure.</p>
